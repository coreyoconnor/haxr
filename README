test/ contains some sample program, see test/README
doc/  is where the API documentation goes if you build it


Requirements:

- A recent version of GHC (only tested with GHC 6.0.1 and 6.2) or 
  Hugs (only tested with Hugs November 2003)
- HaXML (tested with HaXML 1.09 and HaXml 1.10, HaXml 1.10 is needed
  for Hugs support)
- Haddock is needed to build the API documentation.
- The HTTP package.


Compiling:

- Edit config.mk to suit your environment.

- compile:

$ make


Installing:

The XmlRpc package may be installed in your GHC and Hugs directories
by running (NOTE: the hugs installation is not well tested):

$ make install

You can build Haddock documentation from the source code:

$ make doc
