* 3000.9.1 (4 May 2013)

  - Expose Network.XmlRpc.DTD_XMLRPC from the library

    The point is to allow converting to XML using functions from

      http://hackage.haskell.org/packages/archive/HaXml/1.23.3/doc/html/Text-XML-HaXml-XmlContent.html

    which allows for custom serialization of the XML to deal with
    endpoints that don't parse XML correctly.

* 3000.9.0.1 (7 July 2012)

  - Make everything in examples/ directory compile again

* 3000.9 (7 July 2012)

  - Switch from dataenc to base64-bytestring for base64 encoding,
    resulting in dramatically improved efficiency

  - Change the argument type of ValueBase64 constructor from String to
    ByteString

  - bump HaXml dependency upper bound to allow HaXml 1.23.*
